Look at 6 climate regions:
- Sahara Desert
- Dasht-e Lut
- Mojave Desert
- Simpsons Desert
- Antarctic (Cold Stuff)
- UK (Baseline)

In order to choose the locations we can either do:

- Take a centre point, then choose closest 20 points to that centre.
- Choose a bounding box for each region, selecting all points within. 

Methodology:

- Continue with DIC and model selection.
- Use Reverse Jump MCMC
